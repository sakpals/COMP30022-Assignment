# Chlorine-Client
COMP30022 - Team Chlorine

# Synopsis
Android application (for devices supporting Android 4.0 or later) to assist users in finding nearby friends or other potential users quickly and efficiently using a graphical interface, chat functionality, map and augmented reality views. 

# Motivation
Currently the best alternative is for the user to directly contact the friend and have them attempt to provide a description of where they are. This often leads to confusion, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Extending the problem to multiple people trying to find each other further complicates the situation, and can easily result in frustration.
